# Trading card deck

A basic OOP project in Python to create a model of a "trading card deck" and associated functions.

Demonstrates parsing of an example filetype (*.xlsx) and outputting to an example filetype. Basic OOP principles demonstrated,
minus perhaps inheritance. Lots of string manipulation, iterating, try/ except handling. Good documenting procedure!
